DATABASE
--------
Database is an organized collection of data. And data is the smallest unit of an information.

The data can be pictures, programs, or anything else that can be stored in the computer in the binary form.

It is the collection of information related to the similar type of entities in some organized format.

-> Information is the collection of data that have some meaning.
-> Database related to the Employee (each information should be there).
-> Information is, the data or collection of data that provide some meaning.

DBMS (Database Management System) 
---------------------------------

It stands for database management system. It is the application software that will be used to manage the information as the database. You can use other application software also like (ms-excel, notepad, or any file system etc) to manage the information then you may have the below limitation ->

-> Security Problem : Any one can easily read your data without any prior permission. And may be, anyone want to damage your data permanently then you have no option to aviod these kind of problems.

-> Management Of the Information:
Assume that you have stored 1000 records in file system then it won't be in a proper way because if you want to retrive any record, you have search it one by one explicitly. So it will take more time and give maintanance problem.

-> Data Duplicacy : At the time of storing the data, you can insert the same data multiple time. It is known as data duplicacy and give maintanance problem.

-> Sharing the information : Assume that you are having 10 tables, and you want to share some information in another table then you will get the data sharing problem in simple file system.

So these are some problems, you may get while inserting the data (records) into file system etc. You can solve these problems of the file system by using DBMS.

DBMS (Database Management System): These are the application softwares which are used to manage the records or information in managable way. There are types of DBMS as below:

Object Oriented Database Management System
Document Oriented Database Management System
Relational Database Management System
Graph Oriented Database Management System etc.

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) 
---------------------------------------------
RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables.

A RDBMS stores the data in the form of tables and columns. It is a collections of related data entities and it consists the columns and rows. A table is the category of data, like employees, customers, students, and the columns are information about the category, like name and address etc.

Why we are using RDBMS ?
-> We are going to store the information in the form of table.
-> We want to make the relationship between perticular entities. And we know that in RDBMS, entities are called as Table.

It is a type of database management system (DBMS) where the information will be managed in the tabular format. In this type of DBMS, it used to establish the relation between the information available in the multiple tables. So following are some relational databases:
      -> Oracle
      -> MySQL Server
      -> IBM DB2
      -> MS-Access
      -> PostGreSQL
      -> Sybase etc.

RDBMS are followed some pre-defined instruction and rules to manage the information by using DBMS. The instructions are known as SQL.

SQL (Structured Query Language)
-------------------------------

It is the language provided by ANSI (American National Standard Institute). ANSI has provided some predefined rules for the SQL and every databse vendor, or you also need to follow same rules (if you are developing your own database software). SQL is not case sensitive language. SQL can do the following tasks -

-> SQL can execute queries against a database
-> SQL can retrieve data from a database
-> SQL can perform CRUD operation in a database
-> SQL can create new databases
-> SQL can create new tables in a database
-> SQL can create stored procedures in a database
-> SQL can create views in a database
-> SQL can create the sequence
-> SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

DATATYPE
------------
-> If you want to store some data into the column of the table then you have to specify the datatype for the corresponding column.

-> The datatype can be different from one database to another

MySQL               Oracle 
-----------------------------
int                 int
long                long
bigint              number, number(m)
float               float
doubles             number(m,n)
char(n)             char(n)
varchar(n)          varchar(n) (**store 4000 characters)
text                varchar2(n) (**store 8000 characters)
date [yyyy-mm-dd]   date [dd-MONTH-yyyy]
blob/clob           blob/clob
file                file
